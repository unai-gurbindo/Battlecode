## BattleCode 2021

This repository contains the source code of our participation in the BattleCode 2021, a programming contest for two-person teams. Our team is comprised of Mikel Aldea and me, Unai Gurbindo, and we are excited to share our work and contribute to BattleCode 2021.

This repository includes all the files related to our participation in the BattleCode 2021, including the source code of our robot, the necessary configuration files, documentation files, and result files. These files are organized into separate directories for each stage of the contest.

Anyone wishing to take a look at our work or contribute their own changes can do so through this repository. If you wish to contribute, please send us a pull request. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to share our work and contribute to the BattleCode 2021.
